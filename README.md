# Gravitational-Slingshot

This is a school project where we model the n-body problem and try to find conditions that will allow us to slingshot a spacecraft around a heavy gravitational body.

We explore the effects of various different masses and initial conditions.  The goal is that the slingshot maneuver should allow the spacecraft to gain speed as it travels farther away from the center of the system.

To see our code for simulating and plotting gravitational dynamics, see the code folder, specifically [simulation.py](https://github.com/samcochran/optimal-spacecraft-control/blob/master/Code/simulation.py) and [plotting.py](https://github.com/samcochran/optimal-spacecraft-control/blob/master/Code/plotting.py).

To see animations of the system's dynamics, follow the link below.

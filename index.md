# Animations

[Download](https://github.com/samcochran/Gravitational-Slingshot/tree/master/Animations) the animations from here. Check out our [other animations](nbody_slingshot.md) for modelling the nbody problem and finding slingshot trajectories.

Here we have animations of the optimal paths found by our optimal control solutions. The thrust line in the animation is directed opposite the control, representing the direction fuel would be burned in order to generate the thrust required by the spacecraft for the optimal solution.
